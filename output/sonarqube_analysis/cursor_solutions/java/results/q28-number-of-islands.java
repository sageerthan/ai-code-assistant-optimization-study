// Problem: Number of Islands 

//Problem Description:
//Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.
//An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

// Constraints:
// m == grid.length
// n == grid[i].length
// 1 <= m, n <= 300
// grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.

//Code Structure:
class Solution {
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        int islands = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == '1') {
                    islands++;
                    dfs(grid, i, j);
                }
            }
        }
        return islands;                 
    }
}
