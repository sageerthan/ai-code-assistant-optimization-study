# Problem: Burst Balloons

#Problem Description:
#You are given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n - 1. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by an array nums. You are asked to burst all the balloons.
#If you burst the ith balloon, you will get nums[i - 1] * nums[i] * nums[i + 1] coins. If i - 1 or i + 1 goes out of bounds of the array, then treat it as if there is a balloon with a 1 painted on it.
#Return the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.

# Constraints:
# n == nums.length
# 1 <= n <= 300
# 0 <= nums[i] <= 100

#Code Structure:
class Solution(object):
    def maxCoins(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        nums = [1] + nums + [1]
        n = len(nums)
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]

        for left in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            for right in range(left + 2, n):
                for i in range(left + 1, right):
                    dp[left][right] = max(dp[left][right], nums[left] * nums[i] * nums[right] + dp[left][i] + dp[i][right])

        return dp[0][n - 1]
