// Problem: Climbing Stairs

//Problem Description:
//You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
//Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

// Constraints:
// 1 <= n <= 45

//Code Structure:

class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        dp[1] = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}
