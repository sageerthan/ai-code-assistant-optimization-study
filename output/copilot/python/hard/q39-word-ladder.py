# Problem: Word Ladder

#Problem Description:
#A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:
#Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
#Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
#sk == endWord
#Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists.

# Constraints:
# 1 <= beginWord.length <= 10
# endWord.length == beginWord.length
# 1 <= wordList.length <= 5000
# wordList[i].length == beginWord.length
# beginWord, endWord, and wordList[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
# beginWord != endWord
# All the words in wordList are unique.

#Code Structure:

        :type endWord: str
