# Problem: Sort Colors

#Problem Description:
#Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
#We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.
#You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

# Constraints:
# n == nums.length
# 1 <= n <= 300
# nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.

#Code Structure:

class Solution(object):
    def sortColors(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """ 
        low, mid, high = 0, 0, len(nums) - 1
        
        while mid <= high:
            if nums[mid] == 0:
                nums[low], nums[mid] = nums[mid], nums[low]
                low += 1
                mid += 1
            elif nums[mid] == 1:
                mid += 1
            else:
                nums[mid], nums[high] = nums[high], nums[mid]
                high -= 1
