# Problem: Product of Array Except Self

#Problem Description:
#Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
#The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
#You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

# Constraints:
# 2 <= nums.length <= 10^5
# -30 <= nums[i] <= 30
# The input is generated such that answer[i] is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

#Code Structure:

class Solution(object):
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        n = len(nums)
        result = [1] * n
        
        # Calculate left products
        for i in range(1, n):
            result[i] = result[i - 1] * nums[i - 1]
        
        # Calculate right products and multiply with left products
        right_product = 1
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            result[i] *= right_product
            right_product *= nums[i]
        
        return result
